# One Page Calendar

**OPG** is a locale-aware one page calendar based on an idea I found on the
Internet. It makes intensive use of [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to detect
and show correct locale dates and names.

## How to use

You can watch it work live at https://breadmaker.github.io/one-page-calendar/
There, you will be able to see the calendar with the current day, toggle Dark
Mode, and even print a copy of the calendar of the current year.
