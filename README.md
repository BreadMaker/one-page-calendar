# One Page Calendar

**OPG** is a locale-aware one page calendar based on an idea I found on the
Internet. It makes intensive use of [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to detect
and show correct locale dates and names.

## How to use

You can watch it work live at https://breadmaker.github.io/one-page-calendar/
There, you will be able to see the calendar with the current day, toggle Dark
Mode, and even print a copy of the calendar of the current year.

Unfortunately, due to a [bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1247609),
you will not be able to print from Firefox for Android.

## How to help

This may have bugs, if you find one, like
[this one](https://github.com/BreadMaker/one-page-calendar/issues/3), please
[report it](https://github.com/BreadMaker/one-page-calendar/issues/new). I'm
also open to any ideas to improve the experience.
