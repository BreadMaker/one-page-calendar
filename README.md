# One Page Calendar

**OPG** is a locale-aware one page calendar based on an idea I found on the
Internet. It makes intensive use of [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to detect
and show correct locale dates and names.

## How to use

You can't, for now. At least, they way it is right now.
[I'm working on it](https://github.com/BreadMaker/one-page-calendar/issues/1).

## How to help

This may have bugs, if you find one, like
[this one](https://github.com/BreadMaker/one-page-calendar/issues/2), please
[report it](https://github.com/BreadMaker/one-page-calendar/issues/new). I'm
open to receive ideas, also.
